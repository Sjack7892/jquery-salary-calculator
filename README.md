# Salary Calculator

## Description

This program allows the user to input info on employees and have it display in a table. 
After the info is displayed, the user is also able to delete it. While adding or deleting
employee info, the total monthly output will update. If the total monthly output exceeds
$20,000 it will turn red.

I used objects to hold the value of the user input. I then stored the objects in an array and created 
a function to loop through them and determine the total monthly salary of all the employees combined 
whenever input is added or deleted. In order to delete the correct data from the DOM and array I used jQuery 
to traverse the html and find the index of the corresponding element.
